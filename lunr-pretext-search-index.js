  "body": " To All  Calculus I is taught at Portland Community College using a lecture\/lab format. The laboratory time is set aside for students to investigate the topics and practice the skills that are covered during their lecture periods. This lab manual serves as a guide for the laboratory component of the course.   HTML and PDF  This manual has been released with several synchronous versions that offer different features. The essential content of each version is the same as for all others.   A web version is available at , and this version is recommended. The web version offers full walk-through solutions to supplemental problems. More importantly, it offers interactive elements and easier navigation than print versions.  A PDF-for-print is available at . This version is designed to be printed, not read on a screen. To save on printing expense, this version is mostly black-and-white, and only offers short answers to the supplemental exercises (as opposed to full solutions).  A for-printing-with-color PDF is available at . This version is like the above, except links and graphs retain their color.     Copying Content  The graphs and other images that appear in this manual may be copied in various file formats using the HTML version. Below each image are links to .png , .eps , .svg , .pdf , and .tex files that contain the image. The .eps , .svg , and .pdf files will not lose sharpness no matter how much you zoom, but typically are large files. Some of these formats may not be recognized by applications that you use. The .png file are of fairly high resolution, but will eventually lose sharpness if you zoom in too much. The .tex files contain code that can be inserted into other .tex documents to re-create the images.  Similarly, tables can be copied from the HTML version and pasted into applications like MS Word. However, mathematical content within tables will not always paste correctly without a little extra effort as described below.  Mathematical content can be copied from the HTML version. To copy math content into MS Word, right-click or control-click over the math content, and click to Show Math As MathML Code. Copy the resulting code, and Paste Special into Word. In the Paste Special menu, paste it as Unformatted Text. To copy math content into latex source, right-click or control-click over the math content, and click to Show Math As TeX Commands.    Accessibility  The HTML version is intended to meet or exceed all web accessibility standards. If you encounter an accessibility issue, please report it to the editor.   All graphs and images should have meaningful alt text that communicates what a sighted person would see, without necessarily giving away anything that is intended to be deduced from the image.  All math content is rendered using MathJax. MathJax has a contextual menu that can be accessed in several ways, depending on what operating system and browser you are using. The most common way is to right-click or control-click on some piece of math content.  In the MathJax contextual menu, you may set options for triggering a zoom effect on math content, and also by what factor the zoom will be.  If you change the MathJax renderer to MathML, then a screen reader will generally have success verbalizing the math content.     Tablets and Smartphones  MathBook XML documents like this lab manual are mobile-friendly . The display adapts to whatever screen size or window size you are using. A math teacher will always recommend that you do not study from the small screen on a phone, but if it's necessary, this manual gives you that option.   "

  "title": "To the Student",
  "body": " To the Student  The lab activities have been written under the presumption that students will be working in groups and will be actively discussing the examples and problems included in each activity. Many of the exercises and problems lend themselves quite naturally to discussion. Some of the more algebraic problems are not so much discussion problems as they are practice and help problems.  You do not need to fully understand an example before starting on the associated problems. The intent is that your understanding of the material will grow while you work on the problems.  While working through the lab activities, the students in a given group should be working on the same activity at the same time. Sometimes this means an individual student will have to go a little more slowly than he or she may like and sometimes it means an individual student will need to move on to the next activity before he or she fully grasps the current activity.  Many instructors will want you to focus some of your energy on the way you write your mathematics. It is important that you do not rush through the activities. Write your solutions as if they are going to be graded; that way you will know during lab time if you understand the proper way to write and organize your work.  If your lab section meets more than once a week, you should not work on lab activities between lab sections that occur during the same week. It is OK to work on lab activities outside of class once the entire classroom time allotted for that lab has passed.  Lab on related rates uses a strategy for related rates exercises that your instructor may not use in lecture. It is a multi-step process that may take some time to learn. We recommend that you read the examples from this lab before coming to lab. Too much lab time should not be spent silently reading to yourself.  There are no written solutions for the lab activity problems. Between your group mates, your instructor, and (if you have one) your lab assistant, you should know whether or not you have the correct answers and proper writing strategies for these problems.  Each lab has a section of supplementary exercises; these exercises are fully keyed with solutions. The supplementary exercises are not simply copies of the problems in the lab activities. While some questions will look familiar, many others will challenge you to apply the material covered in the lab to a new type of problem. These questions are meant to supplement your textbook homework, not replace your textbook homework.  "

  "title": "To the Instructor",
  "body": " To the Instructor  This version of the calculus lab manual is significantly different from versions prior to 2012. The topics have been arranged in a developmental order. Because of this, students who work each activity in the order they appear may not get to all of the topics covered in a particular week.  Additionally, a few changes have been introduced with the release of the MathBook XML version. The most notable changes are:   The numbering scheme does not match the earlier numbering scheme. This was a necessary consequence of converting to MathBook XML.  The related rates lab has been mostly rewritten using the DREDS approach.  In the implicit differentiation lab, a section on logarithmic differentiation has been added.  The printed version only contains short answers to the supplemental questions rather than complete walk-through solutions. However, complete solutions may still be found in the HTML version.   It is strongly recommended that you pick and choose what you consider to be the most vital activities for a given week, and that you have your students work those activities first. For some activities you might also want to have the students only work selected problems in the activity. Students who complete the high priority activities and problems can then go back and work the activities that they initially skipped. There are also fully keyed problems in the supplementary exercises that the students could work on both during lab time and outside of class. (The full solutions are only in the HTML version.)  A suggested schedule for the labs is shown in the table below. Again, you should choose what you feel to be the most relevant activities and problems for a given week, and have the students work those activities and problems first.  ( Students should consult their syllabus for their schedule. )       Week  Labs (Lab Activities)  Supplementary Exercises    1  through   Supplement    2  through   Supplement    3  through   Supplement    4  through   Supplement    5  through   Supplement    6  through   Supplement    7  through   Supplement    8  through   Supplement    9, 10  through   Supplement ,  Supplement    Students should read the related rates examples before coming to lab.

In the context of that problem the difference quotient being evaluated returned the average rate of change in the volume of fluid remaining in a vat between times and . As the elapsed time closes in on this average rate of change converges to . From that we deduce that the rate of change in the volume minutes into the draining process must have been 6 .  Please note that we could not deduce the rate of change minutes into the process by replacing with ; in fact, there are at least two things preventing us from doing so. From a strictly mathematical perspective, we cannot replace with because that would lead to division by zero in the difference quotient. From a more physical perspective, replacing with would in essence stop the clock. If time is frozen, so is the amount of fluid in the vat and the entire concept of rate of change becomes moot.  It turns out that it is frequently more useful (not to mention interesting) to explore the trend in a function as the input variable approaches a number rather than the actual value of the function at that number. Mathematically we describe these trends using limits .  If we denote to be the difference quotient in , then we could describe the trend evidenced in the table by saying the limit of as approaches zero is . Please note that as changes value, the value of changes, not the value of the limit. The limit value is a fixed number to which the value of converges. Symbolically we write .  Most of the time the value of a function at the number and the limit of the function as approaches are in fact the same number. When this occurs we say that the function is continuous at . We will explore the concept of continuity more in depth at the end of the this lab, once we have a handle on the idea of limits. To help you better understand the concept of limit we need to have you confront situations where the function value and limit value are not equal to one another.

The first of these type laws are called replacement laws. Replacement laws allow us to replace limit expressions with the actual values of the limits.     The value of each of the following limits can be established using one of the replacement laws. Copy each limit expression onto your own paper, state the value of the limit (  ), and state the replacement law (by number) that establishes the value of the limit.             Applying Limit Laws  This exercise is fully worked out to serve as an example.  Find .     The algebraic limit laws allow us to replace limit expressions with equivalent limit expressions. When applying limit laws our first goal is to come up with an expression in which every limit in the expression can be replaced with its value based upon one of the replacement laws. This process is shown in . Please note that all replacement laws are saved for the second to last step and that each replacement is explicitly shown. Please note also that each limit law used is referenced by number.  Use the limit laws to establish the value of each of the following limits. Make sure that you use the step-by-step, vertical format shown in . Make sure that you cite the limit laws used in each step.

The form is called indeterminate because we do not know the value of the limit (or even if it exists) so long as the limit has that form. When confronted with limits of form we must first manipulate the expression so that common factors causing the zeros in the numerator and denominator are isolated. Limit law A7 can then be used to justify eliminating the common factors and once they are gone we may proceed with the application of the remaining limit laws. Examples and illustrate this situation.   Note that the forms of the limits on either side of the first line are , but the form of the limit in the second line is no longer indeterminate. So at the second line, we can begin applying limit laws.    The form of each limit above was until the fourth line, where we were able to begin applying limit laws.

While the idea of rates of change at one specific instant was alluded to, we couldn't explore that idea formally because we hadn't yet talked about limits. Now that we have covered average rates of change and limits we can put those two ideas together to discuss rates of change at specific instances in time.  Suppose that an object is tossed into the air in such a way that the elevation of the object (measured in ) is given by the function defined by where is the amount of time that has passed since the object was tossed (measured in ). Let's determine the velocity of the object seconds into this flight.  Recall that the difference quotient gives us the average velocity for the object between the times and . So long as is positive, we can think of as the length of the time interval. To infer the velocity exactly seconds into the flight we need the time interval as close to as possible; this is done using the appropriate limit in .   From this we can infer that the velocity of the object seconds into its flight is -24 . From that we know that the object is falling at a speed of 24 .       Suppose that an object is tossed into the air so that its elevation (measured in ) is given by , where is the amount of time that has passed since the object was tossed (measured in ).

For example, over intervals where the first derivative of a function is always positive, we know that the function itself is always increasing. (Do you understand why?) Many of these relationships can be expressed graphically. Consequently, it is imperative that you fully understand the meaning of some commonly used graphical expressions. These expressions are loosely defined in .   Some Common Graphical Phrases   These are loose, informal definitions. Technical, precise definitions can be found elsewhere.    Positive function. The vertical coordinates of points on the function are positive. A function is positive whenever its graph lies above the horizontal axis.  Negative function. The vertical coordinates of points on the function are negative. A function is negative whenever its graph lies below the horizontal axis.    Increasing function. The vertical coordinates of the function increase as you move along the curve from left to right. Linear functions with positive slope are always increasing.  Decreasing function. The vertical coordinates of the function decrease as you move along the curve from left to right. Linear functions with negative slope are always decreasing.    Concave up function. A function is concave up at if the tangent line to the function at lies below the curve. The bottom half of a circle is concave up.  Concave down function. A function is concave down at if the tangent line to the function at lies above the curve. The top half of a circle is concave down.         Answer each of the following questions in reference to the function shown in . Each answer is an interval (or intervals) along the -axis.   Use interval notation when expressing your answers.

The vertical coordinates of points on the function are negative. A function is negative whenever its graph lies below the horizontal axis.    Increasing function. The vertical coordinates of the function increase as you move along the curve from left to right. Linear functions with positive slope are always increasing.  Decreasing function. The vertical coordinates of the function decrease as you move along the curve from left to right. Linear functions with negative slope are always decreasing.    Concave up function. A function is concave up at if the tangent line to the function at lies below the curve. The bottom half of a circle is concave up.  Concave down function. A function is concave down at if the tangent line to the function at lies above the curve. The top half of a circle is concave down.     "

When you differentiate, the resultant function is unique. When you antidifferentiate, you do not get a unique function you get a family of functions; specifically, you get a set of parallel curves.  We introduce a new function in the antidifferentiation chain. We say that is an antiderivative of .

  "body": " Graphical Features from Derivatives  When given a function formula, we often find the first and second derivative formulas to determine behaviors of the given function. In a later lab we will use the first and second derivative formulas to help us graph a function given the formula for the function. One thing we do with the derivative formulas is determine where they are positive, negative, zero, and undefined. This helps us determine where the given function is increasing, decreasing, concave up, concave down, and linear.     In the next few exercises, you will construct a function and then answer questions about it.    Signs on and       Interval       Positive  Negative     Positive  Positive              Draw onto a continuous function that has a horizontal tangent line at the point along with the properties stated in .    Given the conditions stated in , does it have to be the case that ?    Is increasing at ? How do you know?    Can a continuous, everywhere differentiable function satisfy the properties stated in and not have a slope of zero at ? Draw a picture that supports your answer.      In the next few exercises, you will construct a function and then answer questions about it.    Signs on and       Interval       Positive  Positive     Positive  Negative              Draw onto a continuous function that has a vertical tangent line at the point along with the properties stated in .    Given the conditions stated in , does it have to be the case that is undefined?    Is increasing at ? How do you know?    Can a continuous, everywhere differentiable function satisfy the properties stated in and not have a vertical tangent line at ? Draw a picture that supports your answer.      In the next few exercises, you will construct a function and then answer questions about it.    Signs on and       Interval       Negative  Positive     Positive  Negative              Draw onto the graph of a continuous function that passes through the point and also satisfies the properties stated in .    At what values of is nondifferentiable?      You should know by now that the first derivative continually increases over intervals where the second derivative is constantly positive and that the first derivative continually decreases over intervals where the second derivative is constantly negative. A person might infer from this that a function changes more and more quickly over intervals where the second derivative is constantly positive and that a function changes more and more slowly over intervals where the second derivative is constantly negative. We are going to explore that idea in this problem.    Suppose that is the volume of water in an ice cube ( ) where is the amount of time that has passed since noon (measure in minutes). Suppose that and that has a constant value of over the interval . What is the value of ? When is changing more quickly, at 12:06 pm or at 12:11 pm?    Referring to the function in , what would the shape of be over the interval ? (Choose from options .)                                 Again referring to options , which functions are changing more and more rapidly from left to right and which functions are changing more and more slowly from left to right? Which functions have positive second derivatives and which functions have negative second derivatives? Do the functions with positive second derivative values both change more and more quickly from left to right?    Consider the signs on both the first and second derivatives in options . Is there something that the two functions that change more and more quickly have in common that is different in the functions that change more and more slowly?      Resolve each of the following disputes.    One day Sara and Jermaine were working on an assignment. One question asked them to draw a function over the domain with the properties that the function is always increasing and always concave down. Sara insisted that the curve must have a vertical asymptote at and Jermaine insisted that the function must have a horizontal asymptote somewhere. Were either of these students correct?    The next question Sara and Jermaine encountered described the same function with the added condition that the function is never positive. Sara and Jermaine made the same contentions about asymptotes. Is one of them now correct?    At another table Pedro and Yoshi were asked to draw a continuous curve that, among other properties, was never concave up. Pedro said OK, so the curve is always concave down to which Yoshi replied Pedro, you need to open your mind to other possibilities. Who's right?    In the next problem Pedro and Yoshi were asked to draw a function that is everywhere continuous and that is concave down at every value of  except  . Yoshi declared impossible and Pedro responded have some faith, Yosh-man. Pedro then began to draw. Is it possible that Pedro came up with such a function?      Determine the correct answer to each of the following questions. Pictures of the situation may help you determine the correct answers.    Which of the following propositions is true? If a given proposition is not true, draw a graph that illustrates its untruth.   If the graph of has a vertical asymptote, then the graph of must also have a vertical asymptote.  If the graph of has a vertical asymptote, then the graph of must also have a vertical asymptote.     Suppose that the function is continuous, concave down, and is such that and . Which of the following is true?      There is not enough information to determine the relationship between and .      "

The most realistic value for is .   Because is defined as the amount of water left in the tank, . So , and then the answer here is just the negative of the previous answer, using the same reasoning.The most realistic value for is .      For each statement in Exercises , decide which of the following is true.   The statement is true regardless of the specific function .  The statement is true for some functions and false for other functions.  The statement is false regardless of the specific function .     If a function is increasing over the entire interval and exists, then .   The statement is true for some functions and false for other functions.   For some functions, may be . For say a linear increasing function, the statement would be true. So the statement is true for some functions and false for other functions.    If a function is increasing over the entire interval and exists, then .   The statement is true for some functions and false for other functions.   Imagine a function like , where the statement is true. For a linear increasing function, the statement would be false. So the statement is true for some functions and false for other functions.    If a function is concave down over the entire interval and exists, then .   The statement is true for some functions and false for other functions.   It's easy to imagine functions where this would be true, but there are also functions where is . So the statement is true for some functions and false for other functions.    If the slope of is increasing over the entire interval and exists, then .   The statement is true for some functions and false for other functions.   This tells us that is concave up, so , but could still be anything. So the statement is true for some functions and false for other functions.    If a function has a local maximum at , then .   The statement is true for some functions and false for other functions.   It's easy to imagine functions where this would be true, like .

True   It appears that is undefined because the limit of secant slopes from the left is positive, while the limit from the right is negative. So the statement is true.    True or False? The first derivative of the given function is periodic (starting at ).   True   Since the tangent slope anywhere (except multiples of , where the tangent slope is undefined) is equal to the tangent slope units forward, the derivative is periodic with period . So the statement is true.    True or False? Antiderivatives of the given function are periodic (starting at ).   False   An antiderivative would be increasing over half of each period, and decreasing over the other half. But it would be increasing more steeply in general while it is increasing compared to where it is decreasing. So over each period, there will be a net rise. So the statement is false.    True or False? If the given function was measuring the rate at which the volume of air in your lungs was changing seconds after you were frightened, then there was the same amount of air in your lungs seconds after the fright as was there seconds after the fright.   False   The amount of air in your lungs was increasing the entire two seconds. So the statement is false.    True or False? If the given function is measuring the position of a weight attached to a spring relative to a table edge (with positive and negative positions corresponding to the weight being above and below the edge of the table), then the weight is in the same position seconds after it begins to bob as it is seconds after the bobbing commenced (assuming that represents the number of seconds that pass after the weight begins to bob).   True   At both of these times, the weight is level with the table. So the statement is true.    True or False? If the given function is measuring the velocity of a weight attached to a spring relative to a table edge (with positive and negative positions corresponding, respectively, to the weight being above and below the edge of the table), then the spring was moving downward over the interval (assuming that represents the number of seconds that pass after the weight begins to bob).   True   Negative velocity corresponds to downward motion (because the position is decreasing when the velocity is negative). So the statement is true.

  "body": " The Product Rule  The next rule we are going to explore is called the product rule of differentiation. We use this rule when there are two or more variable factors in the expression we are differentiating. (Remember, we already have the constant factor rule to deal with two factors when one of the two factors is a constant.)  Intuitively, what is happening in this rule is that we are alternately treating one factor as a constant (the one not being differentiated) and the other factor as a variable function (the one that is being differentiated). We then add these two rates of change together.  Ultimately, you want to perform this rule in your head just like all of the other rules. Your instructor, however, may initially want you to show steps; under that presumption, steps are going to be shown in each and every example of this lab when the product rule is applied. Two simple examples of the product rule are shown in .   Examples of the Product Rule      Given function  Derivative             A decision you'll need to make is how to handle a constant factor in a term that requires the product rule. Two options for taking the derivative of are shown in .     Option A  Option B    In Option B we are treating the factor of as a part of the first variable factor. In doing so, the factor of distributes itself. This is the preferred treatment of the author, so this is what you will see illustrated in this lab.     Find the first derivative formula for each of the following functions. In each case take the derivative with respect to the independent variable as implied by the expression on the right side of the equal sign. Make sure that you use the appropriate name for each derivative.                  Find each of the following derivatives without first simplifying the formula ; that is, go ahead and use the product rule on the expression as written. Simplify each resultant derivative formula. For each derivative, check your answer by simplifying the original expression and then taking the derivative of that simplified expression.              "

Since the amplitudes of the two functions are the same, the only way can generate periods at a rate of (compared to ) is if its rate of change is three times that of . In fact, ; please note that is the first derivative of .

If we define by the rule , then .     Taking the output from and processing it through a second function, , is the action that characterizes as a composite function.  Note that . This last equation is an example of what we call the chain rule for differentiation . Loosely, the chain rule tells us that when finding the rate of change for a composite function (at ), we need to multiply the rate of change of the outside function, , with the rate of change of the inside function, . This is symbolized for general values of in where represents a function of (  ). This rule is used to find derivative formulas in Examples and .   The factor of is called a chain rule factor .    The factor of is called a chain rule factor .    Please note that the chain rule was not applied here because the function being differentiated was not a composite function. Here we just applied the formula for the derivative of an exponential function with base .    While this is the same task as in , here we view the function as a composite function, and apply the chain rule.   While you ultimately want to perform the chain rule step in your head, your instructor may want you to illustrate the step while you are first practicing the rule. For this reason, the step will be explicitly shown in every example given in this lab.     Find the first derivative formula for each function. In each case take the derivative with respect to the independent variable as implied by the expression on the right side of the equal sign. Make sure that you use the appropriate name for each derivative (  ).                                  A function, , is shown in .

  "body": " Chain Rule with Leibniz Notation  So far we have worked with the chain rule as expressed using function notation. In some applications it is easier to think of the chain rule using Leibniz notation. Consider the following example.   During the 1990s, the amount of electricity used per day in Etown increased as a function of population at the rate of 18 \/person. On July 1, 1997, the population of Etown was and the population was decreasing at a rate of 6 people\/day. In we use these values to determine the rate at which electrical usage was changing (with respect to time) in Etown on 7\/1\/1997. Please note that in this extremely simplified example we are ignoring all factors that contribute to citywide electrical usage other than population (such as temperature). Let's define as the population of Etown years after January 1, 1990 and as the daily amount of electricity used in Etown when the population was . From the given information, , , and for all values of . If we let where , then we have (from ): You should note that is an application of the chain rule expressed in Leibniz notation; specifically, the expression on the left side of the equal sign represents .   In general, we could express the chain rule as shown in .     Suppose that Carla is jogging in her sweet new running shoes. Suppose further that is Carla's pace ( ) hours after 1:00 pm and is Carla's heart rate (bpm) when she jogs at a rate of  . In this context we can assume that all of Carla's motion was in one direction, so the words speed and velocity are completely interchangeable.    What is the meaning of ?

The value of varies from spring to spring.  Suppose that it requires 120 of force to hold a given spring 1.5 beyond its natural length.    Find the spring constant for this spring.

You are asked to do some reading outside of class before you begin working on the lab in class. More explanation is given in that note.   Some points that satisfy the equation are graphed in . Clearly this set of points does not constitute a function where is a function of ; for example, there are three points that have an -coordinate of .   Nevertheless, there is a unique tangent line to the curve at each point on the curve and so long as the tangent line is not vertical it has a unique slope. We still identify the value of this slope using the symbol , so it would be helpful if we had a formula for . If we could solve for , finding the formula for would be a snap. Hopefully you quickly see that such an approach is just not reasonable.         To get around this problem we are going to employ a technique called implicit differentiation . We use this technique to find the formula for whenever the equation relating and is not explicitly solved for . What we are going to do is treat  as if it were a function of and set the derivatives of the two sides of the equation equal to one another. This is actually a reasonable thing to do because so long as we are at a point on the curve where the tangent line is not vertical, we could make a function of using appropriate restrictions on the domain and range.  Since we are treating as a function of , we need to make sure that we use the chain rule when differentiating terms like . When is a function of , we know that . Since the name we give is , it follows that when is a function of , . The derivation of for the equation is shown in .     At first it might be unsettling that the formula for contains both the variables and . However, if you think it through you should conclude that the formula must include the variable ; otherwise, how could the formula generate three different slopes at the points , , and ? These slopes are given below. The reader should verify their values by drawing lines onto with the indicated slopes at the indicated points.          Use the process of implicit differentiation to find a formula for for the curves generated by each of the following equations. Do not simplify the equations before taking the derivatives. You will need to use the product rule for differentiation in Exercises .                       Several points that satisfy the equation are graphed in .

  "body": " Introduction to Related Rates  Consider the following problem.  A perfectly spherical snowball melts at a constant rate of 0.3 . At what rate is the radius decreasing when the radius of the snowball is exactly 1.4 ?  Before we actually solve the problem, let's take a moment to think about the situation. If the snowball were really large, there would be a lot of surface area to account for the loss of water. When the snowball gets small, however, there's less surface area to contribute water and, consequently, the radius will decrease at a faster rate than it does when the snowball is large. Mathematically, this increase in the rate at which the radius changes over time is a result of the manner in which the radius changes with respect to volume.  shows a graph of where is the radius of a sphere of volume . Note that the tangent lines to the curve have greater slope the closer gets to zero. This tells us that a small change in volume has a greater effect on the radius the closer is to zero.   Once the value of gets large, the slope of the tangent lines is almost zero. This tells us that when the volume is large, a small change in volume has almost no effect on the radius.         Since the volume is decreasing at a constant rate, and a change in volume has a greater and greater effect on the radius as the volume decreases, the rate at which the radius decreases must increase as time goes by. This relationship between the rates at which the volume and radius change is an example of what is called related rates .  An acronym sometimes associated with the solution process for related rates problems is DREDS . The first four letters of the acronym stand for Diagram, Rates, Equation, and Differentiate. The final letter stands for Substitute. The reason the substitution steps comes last is that you need to have a rates equation before you have a place to substitute your values.  The first thing we need to do is clearly identify our variables. In related rates problems there are three broad types of variables.   Variables that measure physical quantities. These include, among other things, length variables, angle measurement variables, area variables, and volume variables. We will call these quantity-variables .  Variables that measure rates (with respect to time). These variables always emerge by taking the derivatives (with respect to time) of the quantity-variables. We will call these rate-variables .  A time variable . Depending on context, time may be measured in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, years,   The first three letters of DREDS (Diagram, Rates, Equation) are all interrelated and are not always to be taken literally. Basically they are meant to suggest that you need to identify the rates in the problem (either a given rate or the unknown rate you seek to find), identify quantity-variables that differentiate to each rate, and find an equation that relates those quantity-variables. A diagram is frequently useful during this part of the problem solving process.  Let's make a variable table for the snowball problem. Please note that we will need a volume variable. We know this because of the presence of in the given rate unit; cubic-centimeters always measure volume (just as square-centimeters always measure area and centimeters always measure length). We will also need a radius variable (as the rate of change in the radius is stated in the problem).   Variable table for the snowball problem       Variable  Variable Description  Unit     The volume of the snowball minutes after the snowball begins to melt.      The radius of the snowball minutes after the snowball begins to melt.      The rate of change in the volume of the snowball minutes after the snowball begins to melt.      The rate of change in the radius of the snowball minutes after the snowball begins to melt.      The amount of time that elapses after the snowball begins to melt.      Since we are asked to determine a rate at which the radius changes, we are ultimately going to need to determine a value of . We cannot do that until we have an equation that includes the symbol . There is a two-step process that we follow to find that equation.   Find an equation that relates the quantity variables. This step is one of the places where a diagram sometimes comes into play. This step corresponds to E in the DREDS acronym.  Differentiate both sides of the first equation with respect to time and simplify each side. The resultant equation is called the related rates equation . This step corresponds to the second D in the DREDS acronym.   The quantity variables in the snowball problem are and . We don't need a diagram in this problem as it is standard knowledge that the equation that relates the volume and radius of a sphere is . Now that we have our ( E )quation, we need to ( D )ifferentiate both sides of this equation with respect to , keeping in mind that both and are variables dependent upon . Now that we have our related rates equation (and only now), we can finally ( S )ubstitute the given values into the appropriate variables. Before doing so, we need to alert the reader with an introductory sentence or phrase. We also need to clearly state the values of each of the variables for which we know the value. In most math texts this part of the problem is worked without units. This is because some problems contain constants with hidden units, and it can be confusing when the units do not work out in the end.  Getting back to the actual solution  When the radius of the snowball is 1.4 and the snowball is melting at the rate of 0.3 :   What we know about the variables at the described moment      Variable  What we know     This variable is not in the related rates equation so it is no longer relevant in the problem solving process.     The value of this variable is .     The value of this variable is . The value is negative because the volume decreases over time.     This is the variable for which we need to solve.     From our related rates equation and the values in :     To finish up we need to write a conclusion.  At the moment the radius of the snowball is 1.4 , the radius is decreasing at the rate of about 0.01218 .       Consider the following problem.  A square is getting larger. The sides are each growing at a constant rate of 3 . At what rate is the area of the square growing the moment its area is 25 ?     Create your variable table. Use for the side length.

As salt water boils, the only thing that evaporates is the water the amount of salt in the mixture remains constant. As a consequence, the concentration of the salt in the mixture increases over time.

  "body": " Diagrams for Related Rates  A particular challenge when working most related rates problems is identifying the quantity-variables. For example, when working a problem that involves a right triangle, there are six potential quantity-variables (the lengths of the three sides, the measurements of the two acute angles, and the area). In each related rates problem involving a right triangle, at least two of these measurements must be quantity-variables, or you will not end up with two (or more) rates to relate!   A small drone is flying straight upward at the rate of 0.88 . The drone is tethered to the ground (with a lot of slack) at a point that lies 400 west of the launch point of the drone. Assuming that the ground is perfectly level, determine the rate at which the angle of elevation from the tether point to the drone increases at the moment the drone is 300 above ground.  When searching for your quantity-variables, you need to identify sentences or phrases in the problem statement that contain the word rate or something similar (hence the R in DREDS ). There are two such phrases in this problem:   A small drone is flying straight upward at the rate of  determine the rate at which the angle of elevation from the tether point to the drone increase   The pieces of the right triangle that correspond to those phrases have been marked in as, respectively, and . The distance between the tether point and launch point remains constant, hence the side labeled as . Please note that there should be no other annotations of any kind on this diagram. If writing other numbers down helps you think through the problem, draw a second triangle on your scratch paper and annotate that in any way the helps.

The rate of change in the angle of elevation from the tether point to the drone seconds after the drone begins to rise.      The amount of time that elapses after the drone begins to rise.

This is the variable for which we need to solve.     From our related rates equation and the values in , When the elevation of the drone is 300 and the drone is rising at a rate of 0.88 , the angle of elevation from the tether point to the drone is increasing at a rate of (about) 0.0014 .      Three related rates problems are stated below. Each of the problems can be modeled using a right triangle. The sole task in this problem is to identify which pieces of the triangle correspond to quantity-variables and which piece of the triangle (if any) remains constant as the other pieces change.  For each problem, you need to identify which two or three pieces of the triangle correspond to quantity-variables and which pieces remain constant or are not relevant. For each problem, draw a right triangle and label the pieces appropriately (finally a D for Diagram). When you are done, any given triangle should either have two pieces labeled as variables and one piece labeled with a constant value or three pieces labeled as variables.    A jet is climbing at a constant airspeed of 430 and at a constant angle of elevation of 12 . At what rate is the elevation of the jet changing when the jet is 2640 above the ground? (Assume that the ground elevation below the jet's path does not change as the jet makes its climb.)    A 17 ladder is propped against a very tall wall but the top of the ladder is slipping down the wall. At the moment the top of the ladder is 12 above the ground it is slipping at the rate of 0.2 . At what rate is the distance between the foot of the ladder and the wall changing at that moment?    In Kansas, Highway A runs due north-south for 125 miles and Highway B runs dues east-west for 222 miles. The elevation of both highways is constantly 725 feet their entire lengths. The highways intersect at a point exactly halfway through their runs. One Tuesday a car is travelling east on Highway B at the constant speed of 76 and a truck is traveling north on Highway A at a constant speed of 84 . The car passes through the point of intersection at 4:12 pm and the truck passes through the point of intersection at 4:17 pm. At what rate is the distance between the two vehicles changing at 4:27 that afternoon? Assume that the speeds of the car and truck do not vary at all between 4:10 pm and 4:30 pm.

(preparing for S )  Substitute the known values into the related rates equation and solve for the unknown rate. ( S )  Write a conclusion.     When working with common knowledge formulas, it is important to identify which variables in the formula are really relevant to the stated problem and to then eliminate any irrelevant variables from the formula. Consider the following problem.  Slushy is flowing out of the bottom of a cup at the constant rate of 0.9 . The cup is the shape of a right circular cone. The height of the cup is 12 and the radius at the top of the cup is 3 . Determine the rate at which the depth of the remaining slushy changes at the instant there are exactly 8\\pi of slushy remaining in the cup.  The presence of the cubic-centimeter unit indicates that the problem is rooted in a volume formula. Specifically, we need the volume formula for a right circular cone which is where is the radius at the top of the cone and is the height of the cone.  In the stated problem, we are told the rate at which the volume of the remaining slushy changes and we are asked to determine the rate at which the depth of the remaining slushy changes. The rates correspond to and where and are, respectively, the volume ( ) and depth ( ) of the slushy that remains in the cup seconds after the slushy begins to flow out of the bottom of the cup.  Since the value of is neither given nor desired, we need to eliminate the variable from the formula . We do this by exploiting a property of similar triangles. Two triangles are said to be similar if and only if the three angular measurements of the first triangle are identical to the angular measurements of the second triangle. One thing that is always true about similar triangles is that their corresponding sides are proportional. This latter fact is the only reason we are able to define trigonometric functions in terms of the ratios of the sides of a right triangle!    Slushy Cone      A diagram of the cup is shown in . The radius of the cone at the top of the remaining slushy is labeled as and the depth of the remaining slushy is labeled as . The radius at the top of the cup as well as the height of the cup are also shown.   Use the fact that the two right triangles in are similar to write a proportion that relates , , 3 , and 12 . Solve that equation for and substitute the resultant formula into . Simplify the resultant formula of ; that's the actual volume formula you want to use while solving the related rates problem the formula that relates and .

  "body": " When working with common knowledge formulas, it is important to identify which variables in the formula are really relevant to the stated problem and to then eliminate any irrelevant variables from the formula. Consider the following problem.  Slushy is flowing out of the bottom of a cup at the constant rate of 0.9 . The cup is the shape of a right circular cone. The height of the cup is 12 and the radius at the top of the cup is 3 . Determine the rate at which the depth of the remaining slushy changes at the instant there are exactly 8\\pi of slushy remaining in the cup.  The presence of the cubic-centimeter unit indicates that the problem is rooted in a volume formula. Specifically, we need the volume formula for a right circular cone which is where is the radius at the top of the cone and is the height of the cone.  In the stated problem, we are told the rate at which the volume of the remaining slushy changes and we are asked to determine the rate at which the depth of the remaining slushy changes. The rates correspond to and where and are, respectively, the volume ( ) and depth ( ) of the slushy that remains in the cup seconds after the slushy begins to flow out of the bottom of the cup.  Since the value of is neither given nor desired, we need to eliminate the variable from the formula . We do this by exploiting a property of similar triangles. Two triangles are said to be similar if and only if the three angular measurements of the first triangle are identical to the angular measurements of the second triangle. One thing that is always true about similar triangles is that their corresponding sides are proportional. This latter fact is the only reason we are able to define trigonometric functions in terms of the ratios of the sides of a right triangle!    Slushy Cone      A diagram of the cup is shown in . The radius of the cone at the top of the remaining slushy is labeled as and the depth of the remaining slushy is labeled as . The radius at the top of the cup as well as the height of the cup are also shown.   Use the fact that the two right triangles in are similar to write a proportion that relates , , 3 , and 12 . Solve that equation for and substitute the resultant formula into . Simplify the resultant formula of ; that's the actual volume formula you want to use while solving the related rates problem the formula that relates and .  Go ahead and solve the related rates problem.  "

  "body": " Supplement    A weather balloon is rising vertically at the rate of 10 . An observer is standing on the ground 300 horizontally from the point where the balloon was released. At what rate is the distance between the observer and the balloon changing when the balloon is 400 height?   8   First we make a diagram of the situation.   Variable Diagram      Next we account for the various quantities and rates in the problem.   Variable table for the balloon problem       Variable  Variable Description  Unit     How far the balloon has risen since it was released.      How far is the observer from the balloon seconds after it was released.      The rate at which the balloon is rising.      The rate at which the distance between the observer and the balloon is changing.      Next we find an equation that relates the quantities, and use it to find the related rates equation. When the balloon is 400 in the air, we can determine the values of some of the variables form the related rates equation.   What we know about the variables at the described moment      Variable  What we know     The value of this variable is .     The value of this variable is .     The value of this variable is .     This is the variable for which we need to solve.     Now we can substitute these values into the related rates equation and solve for . So when the balloon is 400 in the air, the distance between the observer and the balloon is increasing at a rate of 8 .    At 2:00 PM one day, Muffin and Rex were sleeping atop one another. A loud noise startled the animals and Muffin began to run due north at a constant rate of 1.7 while Rex ran due east at a constant rate of 2.1 . The critters maintained these paths and rates for several seconds. Calculate the rate at which the distance between the cat and dog was changing three seconds into their run.   approximately 2.701   First we make a diagram of the situation.   Variable Diagram      Next we account for the various quantities and rates in the problem.   Variable table for the Rex-Muffin problem       Variable  Variable Description  Unit     How far Rex has run seconds after the loud noise.      How far Muffin has run seconds after the loud noise.      The distance between Muffin and Rex seconds after the loud noise.      The rate at which Rex is running seconds after the loud noise.      The rate at which Muffin is running seconds after the loud noise.      The rate at which the distance between Rex and Muffin is changing seconds after the loud noise.      Next we find an equation that relates the quantities, and use it to find the related rates equation. Three seconds into their run, we can determine the values of some of the variables form the related rates equation.   What we know about the variables at the described moment      Variable  What we know     The value of this variable is .     The value of this variable is .     Using the diagram and the Pythagorean Theorem, we find that .     The value of this variable is .     The value of this variable is .     This is the variable for which we need to solve.     Now we can substitute these values into the related rates equation and solve for . So 3 after the animals begin to run, their distance apart from each other is increasing at a rate of approximately 2.701 .    Schuyler's clock is kaput; the minute hand functions as it should but the hour hand is stuck at . The minute hand on the clock is 30 long and the hour hand is 20 long. Determine the rate of change between the tips of the hands every time the minute hand points directly at .   approximately 1.248   First we make a diagram of the situation.   Variable Diagram      Next we account for the various quantities and rates in the problem.   Variable table for the clock problem       Variable  Variable Description  Unit     The distance between the tips of the hands at time .      The angle from the minute hand to the hour hand at time .      The rate at which the distance between the tips of the hands at time is changing.      The rate at which the angle from the minute hand to the hour hand at time is changing.      Next we find an equation that relates the quantities, and use it to find the related rates equation. Here we can use the Law of Cosines. When the minute hand reaches 12, we can determine the values of some of the variables form the related rates equation.   What we know about the variables at the described moment      Variable  What we know     The value of this variable is found using the Law of Cosines: .     The value of this variable is .     This is the variable for which we need to solve.     The value of this variable is , since the minute hand goes through an entire revolution every 60 . It is negative, because at the moment we are investigating, the minute hand is moving closer to the hour hand.     Now we can substitute these values into the related rates equation and solve for . So when the minute hand reaches the 12, the distance betwen the tips of the two hands is decreasing at a rate of about 1.248 .    It was a dark night and 5.5 tall Bahram was walking towards a street lamp whose light was perched 40 into the air. As he walked, the light caused a shadow to fall behind Bahram. When Bahram was 80 from the base of the lamp he was walking at a pace of 2 . At what rate was the length of Bahram's shadow changing at that instant? Make sure that each stated and calculated rate value has the correct sign. Make sure that your conclusion sentence clearly communicates whether the length of the shadow was increasing or decreasing at the indicated time.   decreasing at approximately 0.3188   First we make a diagram of the situation.   Variable Diagram      Next we account for the various quantities and rates in the problem.   Variable table for the shadow problem       Variable  Variable Description  Unit     The distance from the lamp base to where Bahram is standing at time .      The length of Bahram's shadow at time .      The rate at which Bahram's distance from the base of the lamp post is changing at time .      The rate at which the length of Bahram's shadow is changing at time .      Next we find an equation that relates the quantities, and use it to find the related rates equation. Here we can use similar triangles. When Bahram is 80 from the base of the lamp, we can determine the values of some of the variables form the related rates equation.   What we know about the variables at the described moment      Variable  What we know     The value of this variable is .     The value of this variable could be found using the similar triangles quation, but since this variable does not appear in the related rates equation, there is no need to find its value.     Since Bahram is walking with a pace of 2 \\emph{toward} the lamp, the value of this variable is .     This is the variable for which we must solve.     Now we can substitute these values into the related rates equation and solve for . So when Bahram is 80 from the lamp post, approaching it with a pace of 2 , his shadow is decreasing in lenght at a rate of about 0.3188 .    The gravitational force, , between two objects in space with masses and is given by the formula where is the distance between the objects' centers of mass and is the universal gravitational constant.  Two pieces of space junk, one with mass 500 and the other with mass 3000 , were drifting directly toward one another. When the objects' centers of mass were 250 apart the lighter piece was moving at a rate of 0.5 and the heavier piece was moving at a rate of 0.9 . Leaving as a constant, determine the rate at which the gravitational force between the two objects was changing at that instant. Make sure that each stated and calculated rate value has the correct sign. Make sure that your conclusion sentence clearly communicates whether the force was increasing or decreasing at that given time. The unit for is Newtons ( ).   newtons per our, for measured in   We don't really need a diagram here, since the equation relating the various quantities has been given.

The rate at which the gravitaional force between the two objects is changing at time .      We have been given an equation that relates the quantities, and we can use it to find the related rates equation. At the moment under consideration, we can determine the values of some of the variables form the related rates equation.   What we know about the variables at the described moment      Variable  What we know     The value of this variable is .     This variable does not appear in the related rates equation, so we do not need to compute it.     The value of this variable is negative, since the objecta are getting closer to each other. Given their speeds at the moment under consideration, the value of is .     This is the variable for which we must solve.     Now we can substitute these values into the related rates equation and solve for . So at the moment when the objects are 250 apart, the gravitational force between them is increasing at a rate of newtons per hour. ( is measured in .)    An eighteen inch pendulum sitting atop a table is in the downward part of its motion. The pivot point for the pendulum is 30 above the table top. When the pendulum is 45 away from vertical, the angle formed at the pivot is decreasing at the rate of 25 . At what rate is the end of the pendulum approaching the table top at this instant? Make sure that each stated and calculated rate value has the correct sign. Make sure that you use appropriate units when defining your variables.   decreasing at approximately 5.553   First we make a diagram of the situation.   Variable Diagram      Next we account for the various quantities and rates in the problem. Note that an angle and an angle rate were given in terms of degrees, but we should convert to radians because the derivatives that we are familiar with for trigonometric functions assume that radians are in use.

The rate at which the angle between the pendulum and the vertical is changing at time .      The rate at which the distance from the pendulum weight to the table is changing at time .      Next we find an equation that relates the quantities, and use it to find the related rates equation. Here we can use the cosine formula for an angle of a right triangle. At the moment in questio, we can determine the values of some of the variables form the related rates equation.

Now we can substitute these values into the related rates equation and solve for . So at the moment in question, the distance between the pendulum weight and the table is decreasing with a rate of about 5.553 .    "

In the first place, they must occur at a number in the domain of the function (which eliminated and from contention in ). Secondly, one of two things must be true about the first derivative when a function has a local extreme point; it either has a value of zero or it does not exist.

The following outline shows the work you need to show when you are asked to write a formal determination of critical numbers based upon a function formula.

Differentiate the function and completely simplify the resultant formula. Simplification includes:   Manipulating all negative exponents into positive exponents.  If any rational expression occurs in the formula, all terms must be written in rational form and a common denominator must be established for the terms. The final expression should be a single rational expression.  The final expression must be completely factored.

  "body": " End Behavior  We are frequently interested in a function's end behavior. That is, what is the behavior of the function as the input variable increases without bound or decreases without bound.  Many times a function will approach a horizontal asymptote as its end behavior. If the horizontal asymptote represents the end behavior of the function both as increases without bound and as decreases without bound, we write and .  While working you investigated strategies for formally establishing limit values as or . In this activity you are going to investigate a more informal strategy for determining these type limits.  Consider . When the value of is really large, we say that the term dominates the numerator of the expression and the term dominates the denominator. We actually call those terms the dominant terms of the numerator and denominator. The dominant terms are significant because when the value of is really large, the other terms in the expression contribute almost nothing to the value of the expression. That is, for really large values of :    For example, even if has the paltry value of ,   This tells us that and that is a horizontal asymptote for the graph of .     The formulas used to graph Figures are given below. Focusing first on the dominant terms of the expressions, match the formulas with the functions ( through ).

Limit Law R1       Limit Law R2       Limit Law R3       Infinite Limit Laws (limits as the output increases or decreases without bound)  Many limit values do not exist. Sometimes the non-existence is caused by the function value either increasing without bound or decreasing without bound. In these special cases we use the symbols and to communicate the non-existence of the limits.  Some examples of these type of non-existent limits follow.   (if is a positive real number)  (if is an even positive integer)  (if is an odd positive integer)  , , ,     Algebraic Limit Laws  The following laws allow you to replace a limit expression with equivalent limit expressions. For example, the expression can be replaced with the expression  Limit Laws A1 A6 are valid if and only if every limit in the equation exists.

Example: (the form is )  The limit value doesn't exist. The expression whose limit is being found is either increasing without bound or decreasing without bound (or possibly both if you have a two-sided limit). You may be able to communicate the non-existence of the limit using or . For example, if the value of is a little less than , the value of is positive. Hence you could write .   . Example: (the form is )  This is an indeterminate form limit . You do not know the value of the limit (or even if it exists) nor can you begin to apply limit laws. You need to manipulate the expression whose limit is being found until the resultant limit no longer has indeterminate form. For example: The limit form is now ; you may begin applying the limit laws.   . Example: (the form is )  The limit value is zero and this is justified by logic similar to that used to justify Limit Law R3.   . Example: (the form is )  The limit value doesn't exist.
