<div class="para">Three related rates problems are stated below. Each of the problems can be modeled using a right triangle. The sole task in this problem is to identify which pieces of the triangle correspond to quantity-variables and which piece of the triangle (if any) remains constant as the other pieces change.</div> <div class="para">For each problem, you need to identify which two or three pieces of the triangle correspond to quantity-variables and which pieces remain constant or are not relevant. For each problem, draw a right triangle and label the pieces appropriately (finally a <abbr class="acronym">D</abbr> for Diagram). When you are done, any given triangle should either have two pieces labeled as variables and one piece labeled with a constant value or three pieces labeled as variables.</div>

<div class="para">In Kansas, Highway A runs due north-south for <span class="quantity">125</span> miles and Highway B runs dues east-west for <span class="quantity">222</span> miles. The elevation of both highways is constantly <span class="quantity">725</span> feet their entire lengths. The highways intersect at a point exactly halfway through their runs. One Tuesday a car is travelling east on Highway B at the constant speed of <span class="quantity">76 mph</span> and a truck is traveling north on Highway A at a constant speed of <span class="quantity">84 mph</span>. The car passes through the point of intersection at 4:12 pm and the truck passes through the point of intersection at 4:17 pm. At what rate is the distance between the two vehicles changing at 4:27 that afternoon? Assume that the speeds of the car and truck do not vary at all between 4:10 pm and 4:30 pm.</div></article>
